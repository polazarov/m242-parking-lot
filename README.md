# Modul 242 - Parking Garage
SmartPark is an advanced and efficient program that aims to revolutionize how parking spaces are managed and used. It harnesses the power of cutting-edge sensor technology to deliver real-time data and intelligent insights that optimize parking allocation and enhance user experience.

## What can our program do?
- Check whether a parking space is occupied or not
- If the parking space is occupied the color should appear red
- If the parking space is free the color should appear as green

We have created a video to demonstrate the functionality of our product, if any further questions arise during the tutorial, you can contact us.

# Getting started
The first step in getting the project running is to clone this git repository: https://github.com/polazarov/m242-parking-lot/.
The next step is to open Visual Studio Code and install the Extension: Platform.io.
Once you see an alien on your sidebar on VSC, you can start coding! 


## M5Stack Core2 - LVGL + TOF Distance Sensor Example

The M5Stack Core2 - LVGL + TOF Distance Sensor Example is a project that showcases the capabilities of the M5Stack Core2 development board, the LVGL graphics library, and a Time-of-Flight (TOF) distance sensor. The example demonstrates how to use LVGL to create an interactive user interface and how to integrate the TOF distance sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and an object.
