# M5Stack Core2 - LVGL + TOF Distance Sensor Example

The M5Stack Core2 - LVGL + TOF Distance Sensor Example is a project that showcases the capabilities of the M5Stack Core2 development board, the LVGL graphics library, and a Time-of-Flight (TOF) distance sensor. The example demonstrates how to use LVGL to create an interactive user interface and how to integrate the TOF distance sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and an object.
